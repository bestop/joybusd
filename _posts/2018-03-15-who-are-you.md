title: Who Are You? You Are Every Single Day.
tags: essay
---
You are the books you read, the films you watch, the music you
listen to, the people you meet, the dreams you have, and the conversations you
engage in. You are what you take from these.

You are the sound of the ocean, the breath of fresh air, the
brightest light and the darkest corner.

You are a collective of every experience you have had in life.

You are every single day.

So drown yourself in knowledge and existence.

Let the words run through your veins and let the colours fill your mind.

-Jacque Fresco
